# Hi there

You're either reading my GH README file or you are reading my [blog](https://justbobinaround.github.io/JustBobinAround/).
Wherever you are reading this, thanks for taking the time to do so!

My name is Bob, also know as JustBobinAround. I usually code a bunch of rust
projects in my free time. As of late though, I have been working on projects at
my job that use a lot of low-code/no-code services. So, I guess my specialties
are all over the place. I'm a Low-level programmer stuck in a low-code world I
guess lol. Anyways, thanks for stopping by and happy reading!
