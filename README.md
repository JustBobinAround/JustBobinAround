# 404
Nah, just kidding. You're either reading my GH README file or you are reading my [blog](https://justbobinaround.github.io/JustBobinAround/).

Oh, you're still here? Fine, I guess I'll give a quick sumary:

- personal projects are mostly in rust
- run a few commissioned websites and services that:
  - use rust w/ axum + htmx
  - are self-managed with nixos and/or docker on a VPS
- projects at my job are all JS mainly with ServiceNow and/or some data analysis with python
- nixos masochist
- neovim is the best editor... but I use my own vim-bindings fork of the helix editor for some reason
- i was a machinist, but was asked to come back to working in tech. idk, this feels relevant some how lol

Prefer working with lower-level abstractions but low-code/no-code pays the
bills. If you need ServiceNow consulting, have a rust project that's gotten out
of hand, or just general SWE advice, submit an issue [here](https://github.com/JustBobinAround/JustBobinAround/issues) and I might answer it.
