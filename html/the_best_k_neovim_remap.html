        <h1>The Best K NeoVim Remap</h1>
<p>If you aren't a NeoVim user, I am sorry for you're loss. If you are a NeoVim
user, keep reading, this is for you:</p>
<p>If you read the title carefully, I am talking about remapping &quot;K&quot;, not &quot;k&quot;. So
for those that are unaware, &quot;K&quot; usually will try and run a man.lua file for the
current word that your cursor is over. This is great, and I want to keep this
functionality. But for certain languages, like rust or JavaScript, most of the
time I am reading documentation from these three websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">developer.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com">docs.servicenow.com</a> - for my job</li>
</ul>
<p>So my normal usages will usually involve the task of copying something from my code,
googling the copied text, and maybe adding a few refining keywords or site filters.
It may sound like that is a short task, but the time it takes does add up over time.
So after thinking about it for a bit, I remembered that services like google and
duckduckgo have the &quot;I'm feeling lucky operation&quot; where it will instantly redirect
you to the most likely web result. Why not modify &quot;K&quot; to do this instead?</p>
<p>So that's what I did for Rust files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ &quot;BufEnter&quot;, &quot;BufWinEnter&quot; }, {
  pattern = { &quot;*.rs&quot;},
  callback = function()
	vim.keymap.set(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, [[:!firefox https\:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/\?t=h\_\&amp;q=\!+&lt;C-r&gt;&lt;C-w&gt;+site\:docs\.rs&lt;CR&gt;]])
  end,
})
</code></pre>
<p>as well as for JavaScript files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ &quot;BufEnter&quot;, &quot;BufWinEnter&quot; }, {
  pattern = { &quot;*.js&quot;},
  callback = function()
	vim.keymap.set(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, [[:!firefox https\:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/\?t=h\_\&amp;q=\!+&lt;C-r&gt;&lt;C-w&gt;+site\:developer\.mozilla\.org+OR+site\:docs\.servicenow\.com&lt;CR&gt;]])
  end,
})
</code></pre>
<p>So what's going on here? Well, ignoring the terrible wrapping because I suck at css, NeoVim
is taking the current word (just like normal &quot;K&quot;) and then building a &quot;I'm feeling lucky link&quot;
with duckduckgo. I am using duckduckgo because google seems to make more of a fuss
when I try and do this. I have specified different link criteria for each file type i.e.:</p>
<pre><code>site:docs.rs                                            // for Rust

site:developer.mozilla.org+OR+site:docs.servicenow.com  // for JS
</code></pre>
<p>So that way, the chances of me landing at the correct page are higher.</p>
