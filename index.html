        <h1>Hi there, my name is Bob!</h1>
<p>You're either reading my GH README file or you are reading my <a href="https://justbobinaround.github.io/JustBobinAround/">blog</a>.
Wherever you are reading this, thanks for taking the time to do so!</p>
<p>TLDR: My name is Bob, also know as JustBobinAround. You can summarize me as
a Low-level programmer stuck in a low-code world I guess lol.</p>
<p>Ok... you're still reading this. I guess I actually have to write some stuff
about myself.</p>
<p>So, I usually code a bunch of rust projects in my free time. As of late though,
I have been working on projects at my job that use a lot of low-code/no-code
services using the esolang known as &quot;JavaScript&quot;; It's a strange language. I'd
say my dream job is probably to be an embedded systems programmer that &quot;RIIRs&quot;
critical infrastructure or maybe a maintainer for a major compiler/language.
Those jobs don't really seem to be very common though. Perhaps in another life.
Anyways, thanks for stopping by and happy reading!</p>
