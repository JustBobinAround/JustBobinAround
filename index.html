<p>Nah, just kidding. You're either reading my GH README file or you are reading my <a href="https://justbobinaround.github.io/JustBobinAround/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, you're still here? Fine, I guess I'll give a quick sumary:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal projects are mostly in rust</li>
<li>run a few commissioned websites and services that:
<ul>
<li>use rust w/ axum + htmx</li>
<li>are self-managed with nixos and/or docker on a VPS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>projects at my job are all JS mainly with ServiceNow and/or some data analysis with python</li>
<li>nixos masochist</li>
<li>neovim is the best editor... but I use my own vim-bindings fork of the helix editor for some reason</li>
<li>i was a machinist, but was asked to come back to working in tech. idk, this feels relevant some how lol</li>
</ul>
<p>Prefer working with lower-level abstractions but low-code/no-code pays the
bills. If you need ServiceNow consulting, have a rust project that's gotten out
of hand, or just general SWE advice, submit an issue <a href="https://github.com/JustBobinAround/JustBobinAround/issues">here</a> and I might answer it.</p>
