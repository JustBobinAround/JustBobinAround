        <h1>Hi there</h1>
<p>You're either reading my GH README file or are reading my <a href="https://justbobinaround.github.io/JustBobinAround/">blog</a>.
Wherever you are, thanks for taking the time to read through it!</p>
<p>My name is Bob, also know by JustBobinAround. I usually code a bunch of rust
projects in my free time. As of late though, I have been working on projects at
my job that use a lot of low-code/no-code services. So, I guess my specialties
are all over the place. I'm a Low-level programmer stuck in a low-code world I
guess lol. Anyways, thanks for stopping by and happy reading!</p>
